  title: BirdLense UI API
  version: 1.0.0
  description: |
    BirdLense is an automated bird feeder monitoring and analytics system. It uses video and audio processing to detect, identify, and log bird (and other animal) visits, providing rich statistics, visualizations, and configuration options via a REST API. This API is designed for both human users and LLM agents to:
      - Query real-time and historical bird visit data
      - Retrieve and manage video, species, and food information
      - Access system health, metrics, and storage usage
      - Configure system settings (e.g., detection parameters, notification preferences)

    The API is organized into several groups:
      - UI routes: Endpoints for retrieving and managing bird, video, food, and visit data, as well as system configuration.
      - System routes: Endpoints for system health, metrics, activity logs, and storage management.
      - Settings: Endpoints for reading and updating the system configuration.

    All endpoints return JSON. PATCH/POST endpoints may update system state. No authentication is required by default, but this can be enabled in deployment.

    For LLMs: You can use this API to answer questions about bird activity, system status, and configuration, or to automate system management tasks.
